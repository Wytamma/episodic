# Installation

The episodic package can be installed via pip.

```console
pip install episodic
```

Episodic requires conda to be installed. If you do not have conda installed, you can install it via the [miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) package.

Once installed run the following command to install the required conda environments.

```console
episodic env create
```

This will download and install the required conda environments for the pipeline. This includes packages like BEAST, python, R, etc.
